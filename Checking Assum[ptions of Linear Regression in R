library(readr)
heart <- read_csv("C:/Users/shakahme/Downloads/heart.csv")
##Heart data can be downloaded from Kaggle
summary(heart)
# Check linearity by creating a scatterplot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(heart, aes(x = RestingBP, y = MaxHR)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

## Independenc 
We can test this assumption using the Durbin-Watson test 
or by examining a plot of residuals against the order of observations.
#install.packages("lmtest")
library(lmtest)
# Fit the linear regression model
model1 <- lm(MaxHR ~RestingBP, data = heart)
# Perform the Durbin-Watson test
dw_result <- dwtest(model1)
print(dw_result)
## The range of the statistic is between 0 and 4, 
## where a value close to 2 suggests no significant autocorrelation.
##Homoscedasticity
# Create a plot of residuals vs. fitted values
plot(model1)
#The plot helps check for homoscedasticity (constant variance) and linearity.
#If the points are randomly scattered around a horizontal line near zero, it suggests that the assumptions are met.
## Normality of Residuals
qqnorm(resid(model1))
qqline(resid(model1))
###Residual Analysis
# Create diagnostic plots (residuals vs. fitted values, residuals vs. normal quantiles,
#and a histogram of residuals)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model1)

###Outlier Detection
# Example: Influence and Cook's Distance
# Calculate Cook's distance for each observation
influential <- cooks.distance(model1)

# Identify observations with Cook's distance exceeding a threshold 
#(e.g., 3/n, where n is the number of observations)
threshold <- 3 / length(heart$RestingBP)
influential_obs <- which(influential > threshold)

# Highlight influential observations in the scatterplot
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(heart$MaxHR ~heart$RestingBP)
points(heart$RestingBP[influential_obs], heart$MaxHR[influential_obs], col = "orange", 
       pch = 19)
## Multicollinearity
model2<-lm(MaxHR~Age+RestingBP+Cholesterol, heart)
library(car)
vif_values <- vif(model2)
## High VIF values indicate potential multicollinearity issues
##A VIF value of 1 indicates no correlation between variables, while a VIF value of 5 or higher may indicate multicollinearity. 
##A VIF value of 10 or higher may indicate serious multicollinearity.
